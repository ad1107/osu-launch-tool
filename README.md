## Purpose

Playing osu! with a drawing tablet often benefits from low-latency drivers like OpenTabletDriver. 
- However, for general desktop use or drawing applications, the Wacom driver are usually preferred. 
- Switching between these involves manually clicking scripts and troubleshooting â€“ a tedious and error-prone task.

This provides ways automate driver switching, manage display resolution, and handle common tasks with easy actions.


- Windows **only** (10 is recommended) - requires Admin privilege.
  

## Features

  
*  **One-Click Driver & Game Actions:**

	*  **Run osu! with OTD:** Disables Wacom drivers, launches OpenTabletDriver, and starts osu!. Or simply  **Run osu! Only** 

	*  **Disable Wacom & Run OTD** and  **Disable OTD & Enable Wacom:** Easy driver switching.

	*  **Display Resolution Control:** Downscaling or Reverting to normal resolution.

*  **Utility Functions:**
